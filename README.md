# NLP-SentimentAnalysis
Sentiment analysis is to determine the emotional tone of the tweets. It is used to identify the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a tweet, as well as more specific emotions like joy, anger, or sadness.
For this analysis, we used tweets data that are collected from the Twitter API and stored in a Git repository. Preprocessing the data, cleaning it of any irrelevant information and ensuring that it is in a format that can be easily analyzed.

Next, we used a sentiment analysis library or algorithm to classify the sentiment of each tweet. The two most common approaches for this are using machine learning or natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Popular libraries for this include NLTK, TextBlob, NaiveBayes and VaderSentiment.

After the sentiment of each tweet has been determined, we use data visualization techniques to analyze the results. created graphs and charts to show the overall sentiment distribution of the tweets, as well as the sentiment over time. We also identify specific keywords and phrases that are associated with positive or negative sentiment.

Finally, we interpret the results and draw conclusions about the sentiment of the tweets and the emotions they express. We will also discuss potential techniques to improve the accuracuy of the predictions.
